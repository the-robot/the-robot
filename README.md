Software engineer. Love to read and do stuffs related to **ML/Deep learning** in free time.

- I use daily: `python`, `golang`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `reactnative`
- I'm mostly active in **Python Community**

### Open Source projects I maintain

- [yaat-framework](https://github.com/yaat-project/yaat) `python`
- [covid19-updates](https://github.com/the-robot/covid19-updates) `javascript`
- [sqliv](https://github.com/the-robot/sqliv) `python`

### What I'm doing these days

- Working as full-stack dev at the startup company <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> `golang and typescript most of the time`
- I recently finished [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning](https://github.com/the-robot/deeplearning) course and now preparing for Tensorflow developer exam. <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/j2MdR1QwTi7iX6l3sd/giphy.gif" width="30">
- I like to read deep learning stuffs in my freetime (mostly related to computer vision right now) and currently I am working on object detection project using [YOLOv4](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
