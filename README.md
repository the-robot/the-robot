Software engineer. Passionate about **ML/Deep learning**.

- I use daily: `python`, `golang`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `reactnative`
- I'm mostly active in **Python Community**

### Open Source projects I maintain

- [yaat-framework](https://github.com/yaat-project/yaat) `python`
- [covid19-updates](https://github.com/the-robot/covid19-updates) `javascript`
- [sqliv](https://github.com/the-robot/sqliv) `python`

### What I'm doing these days

- Working as full-stack dev at the startup company (`golang` and `js` most of the time)
- Doing [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning](https://github.com/the-robot/deeplearning) in my free time
